                &nbsp; There are many types of phishing attacks that phishers may use, with the list of tactics only getting longer. Some familiar examples are:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc px-12 my-2 text-left">
                <li className='font-sans'>Bulk phishing emails (e.g.: janedoe@<span className='underline'>rn</span>icrosoft.com -impersonating janedoe@<span className='underline'>m</span>icrosoft.com)</li>
                <li className='font-sans'>Spear phishing (e.g: impersonating a colleague)</li>
                <li className='font-sans'>SMS phishing, or smishing</li>
                <li className='font-sans'>Voice phishing, or vishing</li>
                <li className='font-sans'>.. and the list goes on.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className='p-2 font-inter text-left'>
                &nbsp; Phishing email statistics suggest that nearly 1.2% of all emails sent are malicious, which in numbers translates to <a className="text-blue-600" href='https://www.zdnet.com/article/three-billion-phishing-emails-are-sent-every-day-but-one-change-could-make-life-much-harder-for-scammers/'>3.4 billion phishing</a> emails daily. For every 4,200 emails sent, 1 would most likely be a phishing scam email.
              </p>
              <p className='p-2 text-md font-semibold font-inter text-center'>
                Although this application is not an email, it can very well be linked to you through one. In having individuals enter their information into a simple form (an action), these individuals are opting into exposing themselves to cybercriminals and their ill intentions.
              </p>
              <p className='p-2 font-inter text-left'>
                &nbsp; To prevent falling for these tactics, individuals should verify sender details, be cautious of urgent requests for sensitive information, and undergo regular cybersecurity awareness training. Implementing these measures, along with email filtering, enhances overall resilience against phishing threats.
              </p>
              <p className='p-2 font-inter text-left'>
                &nbsp; The volume of attempts are growing with the intent to steal our information, that's personal only to you. In this digital age, where opting to share our information without concern of who sees it and how it will be used, I hope this simulation is a gentle nudge towards skepticism and having you think twice about who you're sharing your information with and whether it's worth the costs.
